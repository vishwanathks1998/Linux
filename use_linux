There are several reasons why one might choose to use Linux:

•Open-source: Linux is open-source software, meaning that the source code is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. This allows for a large and active community of developers to contribute to the development and maintenance of the operating system.

•Customizability: Linux is highly customizable, and users can easily install and configure different software packages to suit their needs.

•Stability and security: Linux architecture is known for its stability and security, as it is highly modular which means each component works independently reducing the chances of system-wide failure. Being open source, Linux is continuously scrutinized and improved by a global community of developers. Bugs and vulnerabilities are quickly identified and resolved. 

•Cost-effective: Linux is free to download and use, making it a cost-effective option for individuals and businesses.

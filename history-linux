History of Linux
A popular open-source operating system is Linux. It was initially created by Linus Torvalds in 1991.
At the time, Torvalds was a computer science student at the University of Helsinki, Finland and began working 
on the Linux project as a personal endeavor. The name Linux is a combination of his first name, Linus, and Unix,
the operating system that inspired his projects. At the time, most operating systems were proprietary and expensive. 
Torvalds wanted to create an operating system that was freely available to anyone who wanted to use the operating system, 
He originally released Linux as free software under the GNU General Public License. 
This meant that anyone could use, modify, and redistribute his source code.
